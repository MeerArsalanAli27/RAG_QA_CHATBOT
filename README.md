# RAG-based PDF Q&A with Streamlit

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **RAG-based PDF Q&A System** built using **Streamlit, OpenAI API, FAISS, and LangChain**. The application allows users to upload a **PDF file**, process it into a **vector database** (FAISS), and then interact with the document by asking **questions**. The system retrieves relevant content and generates AI-powered answers using OpenAI's GPT-4 model.

## ✨ Features

- 📂 **Upload PDF Files** and extract text for processing
- 🔑 **Secure API Key Input** via Streamlit Sidebar
- 🧠 **AI-Powered Q&A** using OpenAI GPT-4 and FAISS-based retrieval
- 🔍 **Efficient Text Chunking** to enhance retrieval accuracy
- 🚀 **Interactive and User-Friendly Interface** with Styled Chat UI
- 💾 **Persistent Vector Database Storage** for efficient retrieval

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- **Python**: Primary language
- **Streamlit**: Frontend UI
- **OpenAI API**: Language model for answering queries
- **FAISS**: Vector store for fast similarity search
- **LangChain**: Document processing and retrieval
- **PyPDFLoader**: Extracting text from PDFs
- **Pickle**: Storing and loading FAISS index
